fixes:
  base:
    - Confirm the exact error message and time of occurrence.
    - Check if the issue is reproducible and affects multiple users or only one.
    - Collect basic diagnostics (screenshots/log snippets) and note recent changes.
  by_team:
    Network Team:
      - Verify connectivity (ping/traceroute) to the affected host/service.
      - Check VPN client status, route tables, and DNS resolution.
      - Validate firewall/security group rules for recent changes.
    DevOps:
      - Check recent deployments and rollbacks in the last 2 hours.
      - Inspect service health (pods/containers) and restart failing instances.
      - Review CPU/memory saturation and autoscaling events.
    Application Support:
      - Confirm the impacted feature and affected user roles.
      - Check application logs for exceptions around the timestamp.
      - Attempt cache clear/session reset and re-test.
    Database Team:
      - Check DB health metrics (connections, locks, replication lag).
      - Identify slow queries and validate indexes for affected tables.
      - Confirm recent schema/migration changes and roll back if needed.
    Security Team:
      - Quarantine impacted endpoint/user account and rotate credentials if needed.
      - Review security alerts (EDR/SIEM) for correlated indicators.
      - Preserve evidence and escalate per incident response playbook.
    Access Management:
      - Confirm user identity and required access level/role.
      - Check account lock status, MFA status, and password policy compliance.
      - Re-sync directory/group membership and retry login.
  p1_addendum:
    - Open a live incident bridge and post updates every 15 minutes.
    - Declare incident and assign an incident commander.
